I was involved in this great project by my friend [Victor Gaydov](https://gavv.github.io/about/), who is
very passioned and talented developer. We met during the work at TradingView.
While I write these lines the project isn't released yet for some difficulties
due to the lack of time and so on. Anyway if you look at the source code it is
very clean and well-designed. Hope that we will release 1.0 someday.
