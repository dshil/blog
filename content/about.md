All my networks profile start with a phrase: "I'm a ghost software engineer and
Linux lover". I passion about building stuff with other talented people. I
believe in an open-source way of building very complex systems. By open-source
I mean the full autonomy of developers when people are combined together in
some "tribes" to build something great.

Running is a big part of my life. It helps me to overcome long-term goals and
understand that each problem can be solved, that is very important on daily
basis of a software engineer.
