## Preface

I hope not to write more articles about issues that I have with my eyes. To summarize what is going on it is better to start with 2 articles, [1](https://dshil.github.io/blog/fight_for_better_health/) and [2](https://dshil.github.io/blog/fight_for_better_health_2/). It was started so long ago, so for now it is better to briefly explain what I have. The issue was that I could not work in front of my laptop no longer then 30 minutes without eyes stress and headaches. Because of that I also had the continued insomnia. In this article I want to share what happened after.

Based on the timeline above I want to provide more details about each period. For each period I want to answer the following questions:

- What is the current status with my eyes
- What are the techniques I use to overcome the existing issue
- What mistakes I make during this period
- What conclusion can I provide for this period

### Aug, 2019

#### Intro

I was coming back from the long traveling because it was impossible to work and live with the existing stress because of eyes and headaches. I was moving back to Saint-Petersburg to find a doctor that will help me somehow.

#### QA

What is the current status with my eyes:

- I can't work longer then 25 minutes
- I get headaches all the time

What are the techniques I use to overcome the existing issue

- Use tears substitutes during the day
- Use moisturizing eye gel during the night
- Use medications for eyes relaxation (special drops)
- Perform eyes exercise twice a day

What mistakes I make during this period

- Punched glasses - this is a special glasses that, in theory, should force your eyes muscles to work better, but in reality because of using it my eyesight has almost halved, I was required 2 months for my eyesight to recover. Please, ask your doctor first before using it.

- Medications for eyes relaxation - it was a time bomb. If you asked me what I want to change in my life, I would say that I wish I hadn't met the doctor who prescribed this treatment for so long. The issue was that I had the eyes tension during and after the working day, the idea was very simple: since muscles are so tight we need to relax them.
