Most of the software companies have migrated to the very convenient and cute
messenger, called Slack.

To be the decent man I also liked it for a first time. It gave me the feeling
of involving in the whole company life. I was a superhero observing different
tasks, simultaneously solving different issues.

Once I realized that it's so convenient that I was simply chatting with the
college about random stuff. In that evening I had a bell ringing in my head
that something wrong with the model that most developers definitely love.
After that I remember about emails, mailing lists, IRC and other "things from
the previous century".

You may think that in 21-century using email seems odd, you're right but let's
see on this from the other side:

* Zero level of multitasking.
* No need to instantly reply to a message.
* More importantly writing an email slows you down, forces you to stop and
  think before sending a letter.

Happy hacking and please think slow sometimes.
