TradingView is all about real-time trading data. My team is responsible for
the Data layer. We are responsible for the fact that the data will come from
point A to point B and this will happen without any data loss and at fast
speed. We are building the HTTP server proxy written in Go. Because of the
real-time my team thinks a lot about:

* Various caches
* Balancing
* High load
* Fast recovery from the failure
* Memory consumption (because of Go GC)

Moreover, I really like the TradingView approach about how the processes and
culture in the company should work. The main responsibility of each person is
to be as automotive as possible and understand the meaning of "feature owner",
"feature lead".
