Most of the software companies have migrated to the very convenient and cute
messenger, called Slack.

To be the decent man I also liked it for the first time. It gave me the feeling
of involving in the whole company life. I was a superhero observing different
tasks, simultaneously solving different issues.

But once I've realized that it's so convenient that I was simply chatting with
the college about random stuff.

In that evening I had a bell ringing in my head that something wrong with the
model that most developers definitely love.

After thinking a while about it I've remembered how Linux Kernel developers
communicate by using emails to send the patches.

You may think that in 21-century email usage seemed obsolete. Let's see on
this from the other side:
- No need to instantly reply to the message.
- The level of distracting is very low.
- Zero level of multitasking.
- The mailer definitely will think twice and careful before sending the mail.

The last thing is very important because it develops the ability to formulate
thoughts. Like Richard Feynman said: "You should explain the idea in such way
so it will be understood by the 6 years old child".

Happy hacking and please think slow sometimes.
